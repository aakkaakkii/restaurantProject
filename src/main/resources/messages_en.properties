about.storyBody3 = The style of Georgian cuisine has a lot of selection; it has been forming for centuries. It combines coarse mountain aromas and the gentle seaside flavors harmoniously.
about.storyBody4 = Food for Georgians is not just an eating process. It is the best place for conversation, expression of emotions and relationships. It is a well-known fact that Georgia is famous for its hospitality. The phenomenon of respect for the visitor is originally expressed in the genes of the Georgians. A clear example of it is Mrs.Manana who was born in one of the most beautiful seaside city- Gagra. Her father passed away at a young age. The youngest of six siblings had to take care of nutrition of a mother tired from work and her older sisters and brothers. Guests were common to the family, including tourists, so the little hostess had to improvise in the kitchen a lot. She created new meals from garden-picked natural vegetables, sought different taste permanently and made delicious desserts from ripe fruit. These qualities have evolved, refined, developed into a habit, and she continues to work with great responsibility. It was the love of Georgian cuisine and family that made Manana realize her potential and talents, open a restaurant and share the European community with Georgian culinary culture.
about.storyBody5 = "Georgian Kitchen"  is  family-style restaurant built on Georgian traditions. It represents an extraordinary mix of the Eastern and Western culinary culture. Despite the fact that for our meals, we use usual and known ingredients for the whole world, mixing different proportions of them and using species, they acquire unique taste and texture. Our menu is rich in vegan and non-vegan meals. Some of them are made according to the recipes of Barbare Eristavi-Jorjadze, a famous 19th century cook and writer, the first Georgian women's rights defender.
about.storyBody6 = Georgia is the homeland of wine; the vine is grown almost everywhere. Georgian wine is cooked in the "pitcher" - a clay vessel in the land, which has been used for a long time to produce this divine drink from grape juice. Our restaurant bar is rich in many varieties of Georgian wines and offers its diverse range to guests.
about.storyBody7 = Exceptional cozy atmosphere, exquisite interior design, delicious food and excellent wine, all await you at the restaurant "Georgian Kitchen", which promises a pleasant rest and true Georgian adventure to the guests tired from the big city noise.
